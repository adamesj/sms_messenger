The goal of this assignment, as part of Startup Institute's interview process, was to use Twilioâ€™s API to create a web app that sends a standard text message to a user submitted phone number.

The criteria for passing the assignment included:

- Effective use of a RESTful API
- Build a user focused web application
- Host a web app on the internet

The program was built using Ruby and Sinatra, with Bootstrap to design the Front End of the application.

If you would like to test the application, please send me a message at ([jimmy.adames@gmail.com](http://jimmy.adames@gmail.com)) and I will provide the login credentials for you.
